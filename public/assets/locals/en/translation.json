      "description1": "This is a rebranding I did as a passion project. EuroSpin is an organized food distribution company at a big scale that operates in the 'discount channel'. They have more than 1200 stores in Italy, Slovenia and Croatia.",
      "description2": "I decided to give the logo a fresher more friendly look, using a sans serif font that is very roundy and deconstructed; trying to push away the formalities when you go grocery shop.",
      "description3": "The second part of the logo that represents 'SPesa INteligente', the slogan, was not clear or easy to decipher so I thought it would be better to unify the two words in the same color.",
      "description4": "When we use the square shape with the circle of stars and then the name of the company, we make a crowded and unefficient logo, that is why I simplified it utilizing the star on the 'o' letter, giving the logo a lot more uses without it being contained on the two forms.",
      "description5": "This second usage gives the brand a lot more freedom to use, making it comprehensible and playful. Also making it easily downscaleable for other usages.",
      "description6": "The decision of using Balto as the font is because it is a very friendly and legible font family with various weights. This helps the brand to be more consistent visually.",
